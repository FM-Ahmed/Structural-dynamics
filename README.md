# Structural-dynamics
### modeshape.py
Calculates the modeshapes for a rectangular cantilever beam

# Wind-turbine-loads

### DEL_algorithm.py
Uses the the Rainflow cycle counting alogrithm to calculate damage equivalent load/moment (DEL/DEM) from a time series. Dependent on Rainflow-counting algorithm implementation by iamlikeme (https://github.com/iamlikeme/rainflow).
